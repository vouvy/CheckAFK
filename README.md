- Server Hopping: If the "Beli" value hasn't changed for a specified interval (600 seconds), it triggers a function to hop to a new server.
- Finds New Server: It uses Robloxâ€™s HTTP service to find a list of available servers and randomly selects one.
- Teleports Player: It teleports the player to the selected server.
